# Who was that?
A simple Chrome extension to add on to LinkedIn <br />
Solves an issue of when you meet someone, connect with them on LinkedIn, then when they accept your request you've already forgotten how you knew them.<br />
Or 3 years down the line looking through your connections you have no idea who any of these people were you met<br />
It works by when you add a new connection, an extra field pops up to allow you to leave a note <br />
